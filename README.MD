URL shortening service with analytics and real-time notifications. Using Golang's standard library for the backend and Next.js for the frontend. Used caching, sorting, and drag and drop features to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- <b>JWT Authentication</b> <br>

Saving the JWT as a HTTP only cookie.

- <b>Server Sent Events</b> <br>

When one of the links created by the logged in user is clicked, a notification is sent to the frontend then it is displayed as a toast.

- <b>Redis Caching</b> <br>

I kept the Redis logic simple, current≈üy if a link is clicked more than _X_ amount of times it is saved in the redis to retrieve it faster since it is being clicked "a lot".

Sidebar can be resized and shrunk.

- <b>Drag and Drop</b> <br>

You can sort your analytic charts in the dashboard according to your preference, the order persists on local storage.
